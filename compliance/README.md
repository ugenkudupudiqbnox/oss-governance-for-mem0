# Compliance Mappings

This directory contains control mappings for major compliance frameworks. Each mapping shows how the Governance Pack for Mem0 helps satisfy specific compliance requirements.

## Available Frameworks

- [SOC 2 Type II](./SOC2_MAPPING.md) - Trust Services Criteria
- [ISO 27001:2022](./ISO27001_MAPPING.md) - Information Security Management

## Using These Mappings

These mappings are designed to help your organization:

1. **Understand Coverage**: See which controls are addressed by the governance pack
2. **Identify Gaps**: Determine additional controls you need to implement
3. **Document Compliance**: Reference these mappings in audit documentation
4. **Guide Implementation**: Use control descriptions to configure the pack appropriately

## Mapping Legend

- **✅ Fully Supported**: The governance pack provides complete implementation
- **🟡 Partially Supported**: The governance pack provides tools/framework, requires configuration
- **⚪ Not Applicable**: Control must be implemented in your application or infrastructure

## Important Notes

1. **Not a Certification**: These mappings do not guarantee compliance or certification
2. **Configuration Required**: You must properly configure and operate the governance pack
3. **Organizational Controls**: Many controls require organizational policies and procedures beyond this technical framework
4. **Regular Audits**: Compliance requires ongoing monitoring and auditing
5. **Professional Advice**: Consult with compliance professionals for your specific requirements

## Updating Mappings

As compliance frameworks evolve, these mappings will be updated. Check the git history of each mapping file to see when it was last reviewed and updated.
